0.- Preamble
============

    BEYE (Binary EYE) is a free, portable, advanced file viewer with
built-in editor for binary, hexadecimal and disassembler modes.

It contains a highlight AMD64/PentiumIV/K7-Athlon/Cyrix-M2 disassembler,
full preview of MZ, NE, PE, LE, LX, DOS.SYS, NLM, ELF, a.out, arch,
coff32, PharLap, rdoff executable formats, a code guider, and lot of
other features, making it invaluable for examining binary code.

DOS, Win32, OS/2, Linux, BeOS, QNX, Unix versions are available.

1.  BEYE history
================

Beye was born in 1994 and had the name: "biew". Later it was renamed into:  "beye"
because its name had some negative associations in english. At that time compilers
were  not  able  to  produce highly optimized executables, and CPUs were too slow.
That  caused  many  programmers  to  code in assembly language. In those days many
countries, including Russia, had no Internet access and it was problematic to find
information about CPUs. Many programs produced errors and it was too difficult  to
understand  the  true  source of the problems. The compiler might be defective, or
the program might have design defects or oversights.

After spending a long time  trying  to understand the causes of the defects in his
own programs, the author of Beye coded his own disassembler. Perhaps the needs  of
the author could have been covered by existing disassemblers but it was impossible
to  get  them,  and so he wrote his own. The author of Beye was familiar with some
disassemblers,  like  HIEW  and qview. But these covered only half of the author's
needs.  When  the  project  achieved the functionality of hiew, the author started
redistributing his project to friends.

Initially  Beye  was closed-source, but friends helped to improve the project with
new  ideas,  and in some cases with new code. Later, after purchasing a modem, the
author  decided  to  open  the source and publish Beye on the Internet. The author
understood  that  commercial  profit from selling executables of Beye would be too
low  to  make  much  money.  On the other hand, attracting volunteers would permit
serious improvements of the project.

In 2000, the sources were published at sourceforge.net

2.  Installation and setup
==========================

   Today BEYE is ported under  several  operating  systems.  For  each
operating system there are own nuances of adjusting  the  program.  If
your operating system does not support security or if you always  work
as a Administrator, then the placing of files on the disk is a  matter
of your taste. Otherwise  you  can  place  program  in  your  personal
subfolder (where You have write access). As a rule, you can place  all
files of distribution in the same subfolder.

2.1.- Under DOS, OS2, Win32 following files are needed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   beye.exe - executable module ;-)
   beye.ini - file of initializing and keeping variables between sessions.
              (is created automatically at first launch).
   beye.hlp - a file containing help system. BEYE will search these files
              in startup folder.
standard.skn- a file containing color skin. BEYE will search these files
              in startup folder.
2.2.- For *NIX systems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   beye     - executable module ;-)
   .beyerc  - file of initializing and keeping variables between sessions.
              (is created automatically at first launch).
              BEYE will search for (or try to create) it in the home
              directory; if attempt will fail, then in  /tmp,  if you don't
              have access rights to /tmp, then BEYE will work without it.
   beye.hlp - file containing help system. BEYE will try to open it
              as /usr/lib/beye/beye.hlp and in case of failure will
              work without it.
standard.skn- file containing color skin. BEYE will try to open it in
              same subfolder as beye.hlp and in case of failure will
              work without it.

For more information see unix.txt

2.3.- For all systems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyway, if you do not agree with default  placing  of  files  you  can
create BEYE_INI environment  variable  that  will  indicate  where  to
search a file of initializing a project, through  which  you  will  be
able to define all other adjustment of program.

3.- Program startup.
====================

Why this subject appeared in documentation?
Many people ask me: "How to start a program ?-("
And I considered necessary to  add  this  material,  though  for  many
users it may seem primitive (they can skip this subject).

I skip start the program from the  command  line  of  console  as  not
requiring additional comments.

Main goal of program interface is  working  under  some  shells  (like
Norton Commander, Far, Midnight and etc), to be launched  as  external
viewer by F3 key. In this case adjusting  of  program  is  reduced  to
adjustment of respective file manager. For major  number  of  managers
an adjustment is reduced to instruction - what  external  viewer  will
launched for F3 key. Name of viewed  file  will  be  sent  to  program
through generally accepted in this case '!' symbols.

Example of adjusting calling BEYE for Norton Commander:
`C:\beye\beye.exe !.!'

Example of adjusting calling BEYE for Far Commander:
`"C:\Program Files\beye\beye.exe" !.!'

If You use Volkov Commander, then best edit vcview.ext file:

com: beye.exe !.!
exe: beye.exe !.!
dll: beye.exe !.!
*:   your default viewer

If You use Midnight Commander, then best edit /usr/lib/mc/mc.ext file:

# Default target for anything not described above
default/*
	Open=
-	View=
+	View=beye %f
	Drop=
	Title=%p

### EOF ###

If you are not admirer of different  commanders  and  prefer  to  work
only with GUI shells (like explorer, PM/2 or KDE),  but  herewith  you
even so have decided to use BEYE, the best decision is to create  BEYE
icons  on  your  "desktop",  adjust  its  properties  (such  as   size
consoles, font size etc) and use  drag-and-drop  technology  to  start
the program. (I.e. catch by "mouse" icon of any file and drop it  over
BEYE icon, herewith OS will automatically start BEYE with the name  of
dropped file as an argument). I think, today major number of  desktops
supporting drag-and-drop technology have such  feature  (at  least  it
checked  in  WinNT,  OS/2.  Not  checked,  but  hopefully   works   on
Unix-Gnome, KDE).

4.- Short keyboard guide
========================

   Starting from version 5.00 there is following concept of keyboard
usage:

F1-F10   - Basic functions of BEYE, basically for switching modes.

ShiftF1- - Help functions of BEYE, for calling service utilities.
ShiftF10

AltF1-   - Defined by executable module fragment of BEYE.
AltF10     (PE, NE, ELF, etc.)

CtrlF1-  - Defined by current view mode
CtrlF10    (bin, text, hex, disasm).

4.1.- Basic keys:
-----------------

  F1 - Displayed window "Intro" (About)
  F2 - Mode switch:
                Binary - Binary mode. All characters displayed as is.
                         ( Very quick )
                Text - Text mode. In this mode characters 0AH and  0DH
                       are  string  terminators.   The   program   has
                       several modes of text  view  available  through
                       Ctrl-F2.
                Hex - Hexadecimal mode. In this  mode  information  is
                      displayed in form of hexadecimal digits:
                           Byte - as 8-bit byte,
                           Word - as 16-bit word,
                           DoubleWord - as 32-bit double word,
                           Binary - as bits.
                Disasm - Disassembler mode. Information  is  displayed
                         as   assembly   instructions   of    CPU/FPU.
                         Disassembler contain full instruction set for
                         PentiumIII/K7 Athlon/Cyrix-M2 microchips.
                         Instructions   for   different   chips    are
                         displayed  with   different   colors.   Press
                         [ShiftF1] for color set legend, [CtrlF1]  for
                         known instruction sets.
  F3 - Select other file to view from file list in command line
  F4 - Modification mode. ( Not  available  in  text  mode  ).  Allows
       modifying information in binary, hexadecimal  and  disassembler
       modes. Also it is possible to put the  mask  [F3]  and  execute
       logical operation ( OR, XOR, AND, PUT ) for  input  information
       stream  and  mask.  Current  value   of   mask   displayed   in
       upper-right corner of screen [F2] - save changes to disk.  [F9]
       and [CtrlBkSpace] - restore original values of  modified  byte.
       In text mode this key (F4) switches Wrap/Unwrap modes.
  F5 - Goto. Moves current file pointer on given offset:
        - from start of file (ABSOLUTE mode).
        - from current position (RELATIVE mode).
        - to virtual address (VIRTUAL mode).
  F6 - Reread file.
  F7 - Search. Offers to  input  sequence  up  to  20  characters  and
       searches  for  it.  If  given  sequence  exists  then   program
       highlights it  during  all  lifetime,  or  until  other  search
       sequence, or file rereading.
  F8 - If viewing file is  DOS-driver,  DOS-exe  or  NEW-exe  displays
       "old" "MZ" DOS header. [Enter] - jump on entry point.
  F9 - Setup.
  F10 - Quit function or program. [Escape] - alternative way.

4.2.- SHIFT - common utilities and setup:
-----------------------------------------

  ShiftF1 - Help for current mode.
  ShiftF5 - Where - Display information about current file position.
  ShiftF6 - System information:
            - ASCII table of character generator.
            - ...
  ShiftF7 - Continues search without query for new sequence.
  ShiftF8 - Auxiliary utilities:
            - Digital converter. Convert numbers from one base to other:
              16, +-10, 8, 2
            - Calculator
            - ...
  ShiftF10- File utilities. Utilities that allow  to  change  contents
            and size of current file.
              - ChSize. Change file size.
              - FStore. Write  dump  of  current  file  to  the  given
                filename  of  choice.  It   is   possible   to   write
                disassembler block of information in selected  bitness
                (USE16 or USE32). Not allowed out of range of file.
              - FRestore.  Restores  already  stored  before  dump  of
                information starting from given  position  and  length
                in  file.  Not  allowed   out   of   range   of   file
                (Autotruncation).
              - Insert/delete  -  Inserts  empty  block  or    deletes
                existing block of information with resizing.
              - Crypt block - crypt/decrypt block with user password.
                This feature used non standard algorithm of encryption.

4.3.- ALT - key binding to NEW-exe:
-----------------------------------

Usage of these keys is not hard limited, and  generally  follows  this
conception:

(function is applied only if given feature exists in current format)

  AltF1 - Help for current format.
  AltF2 -  Displays  list  of  external  modules  (dynamic  or  shared
          libraries) referenced by the current module (dynamic  link).
          In  many  modes  by  pressing  [Enter]  list  of  referenced
          external (imported) names (functions) from  required  module
          needed for external link resolving will be displayed.
  AltF3 - Displays list of exported names.
  AltF8 - Displays native (non MZ) header of module.
  AltF9 - Displays list of pages contained in the objects of module.
  AltF10 - Displays object (segment) list of module.

All other keys have function defined by internal structure of module.

4.4.- CTRL - key binding to view mode:
--------------------------------------

  CtrlF1 - Additional mode help.
  CtrlF2 - Select "submode" of view
  CtrlF6 -  Address  Resolution  (Resolving)  -  in  hex/disasm  modes
           controls details of address in left  column.  Will  display
           absolute  file  offset  from  beginning  of  the  file   or
           relative offset from  beginning  of  the  block/segment  of
           current binary format with the name of  block/segment.  All
           other keys are defined by selected mode.

  Note: you can jump on points  in  tables  or  lists  highlighted  by
        black background by pressing [ENTER].

4.5.- Functional keys, that are not displayed in prompt string
--------------------------------------------------------------

Ctrl-O - Review the last screen. This allows  you  to  see  again  the
         output produced by the last program executed.

5.- CodeGuider
==============
 (available only in disassembler mode)

Codeguider is mechanism of moving within code of program.  For  moving
within code following keys are used:

  [0],[1],[2],...[9],[A]([a]),[B]([b]),...[Z]([z]), [BackSpace]

  If there's a pointer in the right position of  disassembler  string:
=>[X] then after pressing key [X] you move to  address  referenced  by
instruction.  To  return  back  press  [BackSpace].  Stack  of  return
addresses is 256 cells.

6.- Invisible features ( dark secrets )
=======================================

   In any program there's number of possibilities which obviously  are
not seen through menu items and prompt, but which influence  upon  the
behaviour or result of program performance, and on them  is  necessary
know all.
   All these functional possibilities with time will be  described  in
the help system, on the measure that, as it will develop.
   Below brought on the whole visibility their incomplete list:

- Help System, if it exists, it is available through  [F1]  key,  even
  though in  the  help  this  obviously  not  specified.  (In  greater
  degrees this concerns windows of dialogues).

- Transition  on  [F5]  saves   in  the  stack  CodeGuider'    current
  position, as an address of return.

- Code page convertion:
  Code page convertion of the document occurs automatically  when
  calling the functions [ShiftF10] => "Save block as...",  if  program
  bases  in  the  "Text  mode"  and   chosen   coding   "CodPag",   is
  distinguished   from   "Current".   Herewith   save   block     will
  automatically be transformed to  the  code  operating  system  page.
  This  fair  for  all  modes  having  not  trivial   realization   of
  convert_cp function (today it is only beside TextMode).

7.- Undocumented features
=========================

Why undocumented if it is placed into documentation?
Because these features were not programmed specially and exist not  in
all ports of project. I do not know all of them, but think  that  this
material will grow.

   For 32-bit version of project on Win32 & DOS32 there's next feature:

   If program runs with wildcard as argument, then automatic  globbing
of wildcard to full name of files occures. Example:

   beye *.c

will equivalent to run of beye with  enumeration  of  all  files  that
have .c extension in the current folder. (I.e. all names  will  exists
in list 'more' through F3  key).  Unfortunately  this  feature  exists
only in libraries of DJGPP and Cygwin, but port for OS2 has  emx-glibc
and proper to rsxnt (for it project does not oriented) does  not  have
such feature. In contrast, such behaviour of project is,  by  default,
documented for all *NIX system.

8.- Program versions
=====================

I'm choose following concepts of appropriation of version  numbers  to
program:

    V.S.E-R.T-C.O

V - VERSION.   Basic   program  version.  Changes   in   case   global
    (strategical) changes in philosophy of program or  when  principle
    new features appear.
S - SUBVERSION. Changes in case serious changes of code or appear  new
    tactical possibilities or features.
E - EXTRAVERSION. Changes at each new immediate stable release and  as
    rule related with bug fixing or adding a little innovations.
R - REVISION.   When   version  is  stable   then   R.T   is   omited.
    Traditionally can to contain approximately following values:
    pre    - PREVIEW VERSION: recommend for preview purposes only
    devel  - DEVELOPMENT: version, intended  for  developers  and  beta
             testers.
    hotfix - extraordinary bug fixing in already released version.
    fp     - fix package
T - TESTLEVEL. revision level of program.
C - CPU. Indicated for which platform build the program.
O - OS. Indicated for which OS build the program.
